| `/games/{playerId}/games`    | GET    | Retrieves all games by a specific player     |


## 🛑 Exception Handling
The application uses a centralized exception handler (@RestControllerAdvice) to catch and return structured error responses for:
+ Empty Inputs exceptions
+ Value out of range exception
+ Game not found exception
+ Player not found exception
+ Invalid move exception

##  🧪 Testing
The project includes:

✅ Unit tests for services and controllers (using JUnit & Mockito)
- start a new game
- get player by id
- player not found

✅ Integration Test
- getPlayerById


🧱 Code is structured for testability with dependency injection

To run tests:
 ```bash
mvn test
 ```
